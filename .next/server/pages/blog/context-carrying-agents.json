The playbook becomes a miniature contract between the agent and the operator.</p>\n<h3>Results we watch</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower variance across retries because the intent stays stable.</li>\n<li>Faster handoffs to humans—people see not just the output but the reasoning breadcrumbs.</li>\n<li>Easier audits when we can replay the state that shaped a decision.</li>\n</ul>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
