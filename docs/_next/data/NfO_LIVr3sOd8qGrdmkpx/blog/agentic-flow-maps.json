Flow maps make that shape explicit.</li>\n<li>They expose the critical checkpoints where we should ask a human, call a tool, or roll back.</li>\n<li>They keep us honest about inputs and observability before we celebrate autonomy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we capture the flow</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Define the anchor: the user goal and its constraints.</li>\n<li>Trace the first-pass path: the happy path the agent would attempt today.</li>\n<li>Layer the guards: add sensors (telemetry), brakes (stop conditions), and rerouters (human-in-the-loop moments).</li>\n<li>Test the edges: run the map against three failure modes and keep refining.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With every revision the agent stops feeling abstract. It becomes a partner with a map, a compass, and a clear way to ask for help.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
