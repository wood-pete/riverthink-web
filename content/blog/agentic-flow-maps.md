We map agentic AI like a river delta: start from a user goal, branch into experiments, and mark where feedback loops reconnect. The first sketches live on whiteboards, but the strongest ones live alongside the codebase.

## Why mapping helps

- Agents inherit the shape of the work we give them. Flow maps make that shape explicit.
- They expose the critical checkpoints where we should ask a human, call a tool, or roll back.
- They keep us honest about inputs and observability before we celebrate autonomy.

## How we capture the flow

1. Define the anchor: the user goal and its constraints.
2. Trace the first-pass path: the happy path the agent would attempt today.
3. Layer the guards: add sensors (telemetry), brakes (stop conditions), and rerouters (human-in-the-loop moments).
4. Test the edges: run the map against three failure modes and keep refining.

With every revision the agent stops feeling abstract. It becomes a partner with a map, a compass, and a clear way to ask for help.
